//Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

//Shawn's notes this is simple to achieve, just intake a name variable input and return the welcome message with the definition using name definition
name = "shawn" //create the name variable, define for the test.
function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;//return the welcome mesage with the definition of name. using ${} and backticking `
  }
